Requirements:
Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
If your Python is installed somewhere other than "C:\Python35", edit "lichess-scid.bat" to change the path.

To start, edit the "config.json" file and put in your lichess username where indicated. You can also change the database name if you want.
Then whenever you want to update the database, run "lichess-scid.bat".
Up to 1000 of your latest games will be downloaded (edit "config.json" if you want more).

Using a separate database from your usual Scid database is recommended to avoid possible data loss.
