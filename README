Requirements:
Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
If your Python is installed somewhere other than "C:\Python35", edit "lichess-scid.bat" to change the path.

To start, edit the "config.json" file and put in your lichess username where indicated. You can also change the database name if you want.
Then whenever you want to update the database, run "lichess-scid.py" (or "lichess-scid.bat" if on Windows).
All of your latest games will be downloaded.

Using a separate database from your usual Scid database is recommended to avoid possible data loss.
